# Release date 

There is no set release date for v0.2.0 at the moment.  

This release will mark the first official build for Iris, so I don't want to rush anything. There will be a few dev builds that users can install to get a feel of the application before release.

The product website will be added closer to the release date. For now, you can use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Iris/discussions) for communication.

# Installation

You can install the latest dev builds from [releases](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Iris/releases).

If you want to build the app directly from source, follow the instructions in [Development](#development).
