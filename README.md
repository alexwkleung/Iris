# PSA

*Taken from v0.1.1 release notes:*

1. v0.1.x are considered prototype builds.

2. v0.2.0 is currently in progress. Please be advised that it may contain implementations that are incompatible with v0.1.x, such as the source code.

3. It is recommended that you install v0.2.0 once it's released since it will be the initial mainstream build for Iris.

# Features (v0.1.x)

1. Mode switching. Switch between WYSIWYG, Markdown, and Reading mode views. 

2. Auto saving. You will never have to press Cmd/Ctrl+S to save your notes. It magically saves on its own!

3. [Milkdown v6 (ProseMirror)](https://milkdown.dev/) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) as the editors. 

    - Milkdown is the WYSIWYG editor, which is a framework based off of ProseMirror. It does the heavy lifting to make the out of the box WYSIWYG Markdown experience nice and easy to use.

    - CodeMirror is the editor used for Markdown mode. You can write in pure Markdown syntax, similar to plain-text style if you don't like WYSIWYG. 

4. A simple and comfortable user interface.
