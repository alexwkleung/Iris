# Release date 

There is no set release date for v0.2.0 at the moment.  

This release will mark the first official build for Iris, so I don't want to rush anything. There will be a few dev builds that users can install to get a feel of the application before release.

Iris is a long-term project on my free time, therefore development will take longer than expected. 

The product website will be added closer to the release date. For now, you can use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Iris/discussions) for communication.

# Installation

For now, follow the instructions in [Development](#development) to try the current build of Iris.
 
# Development 

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Clone the repository

```bash 
git clone <SSH/HTTPS URL>
```

```bash
cd <...>/Iris
```

Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```

Run development build

```bash
# via make 
make dev

# via npm

At the moment, you will need to manually create the directory and files:

```bash
# home directory
cd ~ 

# create main directory
mkdir Iris

# create basic notes directory
mkdir Iris/Basic

# create a note
touch Iris/Basic/Note.md
```
