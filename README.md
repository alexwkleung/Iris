# Why

*Why did I create Iris?*

I created Iris because as a person who enjoys Markdown and nice note-taking apps, I always wanted to create my own. Although I have been discouraged numerous times, I knew that giving up would mean that I wouldn't learn and gain the experience of creating one. Being inspired by your favourite note-taking apps, I knew I wanted to take my dreams into reality. Pushing through, I am finally here now - living the reality. In the short period of creating this, I would never imagine how quick I got things pieced together and somewhat working to my satisfaction.

While it isn't the best code, bug-free, or 100% usable by any means, I know that with time and patience, I can improve further.

Enjoy :)
